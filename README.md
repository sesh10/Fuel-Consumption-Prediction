# Fuel-Consumption-Prediction

## The data contains the MPG (Mile Per Gallon) variable which is continuous data and tells us about the efficiency of fuel consumption of a vehicle in the 70s and 80s.

## Our aim here is to predict the MPG value for a vehicle, given that we have other attributes of that vehicle.
